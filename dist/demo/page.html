        <h2>The rest of me…</h2>

        <p>Born in Sylhet, Bangladesh, I trained in Kathak in the UK, initially with Alpana Sengupta, and later from one of Kathak’s finest exponent Sushmita Ghosh, under whose guidance I made her professional debut In 2001 at the Purcell Room, Southbank Centre.</p>

        <p>My performance ranges from classical Kathak, in which, I have received high accolades for my Abhinaya, to multi-media performances such as the principle performer in the Akademi/South Bank’s outdoor spectacle Escapade and in International Arts’ and Forum for Laboratory Theatres of Manipuri’s production of Macbeth-Stage of Blood on the River Thames.</p>

        <blockquote class="o-box-absolute__top-right">
          <p>“Elegant and serene, delightful style”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I toured extensively both nationally and internationally with several companies including Sonia Sabri, and has worked with reputable dance choreographers such as Nahid Siddiqui, Kumudini Lakhia, Darshan Singh Bhuller, Filip Van Huffel, Jonathan Lunn etc.: My own choreography is fast gaining critical stature. I makes new work using Kathak as the main core of a piece, but uses cross-form mediums in my narrative. In Laal Shaari, I was selected for ROH2 Firsts, I used live art approaches to controversially subvert the Kathak form. That creative approach was also evident and used in my last pure form piece – ONE, commissioned by the Musee du quai Branly, Paris.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Moved with spell binding intensity and glided with fascinating fluidity in and out of traditional movement vocabulary” - “a characteristic aloofness, holding the audience’s attention”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For over a week, the rumour spread among the Afro-Caribbean community, creating increasing anger and tension. Chatting forums on sites such as BlacknetUK, an Afro-Caribbean community-based website, were soon filled with angry, and sometimes racist comments. One comment, for example, called for “boycotting every single Asian business in the country.” Interestingly, the British Council said it has removed links from its website to the site until it was able to discuss why these comments were allowed to be published, never mind that the site had put a call for calm on its homepage: “As the UK’s international organisation for cultural relations, we would not wish to link our websites to any discussion online which promoted intercultural conflict.”</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, 18 October, the rape allegations were given even wider circulation when the story was broadcast on pirate radio station Sting FM, on a talkshow hosted by DJ Warren G.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“urge all members of the community to work towards peace.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Meetings and protests had been ongoing throughout the week in protest at the lack of action by the authorities over the rape, although a West Midlands Police statement on Tuesday claimed “police have been actively investigating this allegation since being first alerted to it on 12 October by an anonymous caller.” Police had conducted a forensic examination of the beauty shop in Perry Barr but found no evidence of rape, and said they cannot do anything without the victim coming forward.</p>

        <p>On Sunday morning, burnt-out cars, blood stains and bricks littering the streets of Lozells told of the violent events. And as usual, a press conference was hastily called to “condemn the violence and urge all members of the community to work towards peace.” Over 40 ‘community leaders’, including MP’s and church leaders, as well as two senior police officers addressed an angry crowd of some 500 people. In the words of Chief Superintendent Tom Coughlan, the aim obviously was “to reassure the community... using many, many community leaders, and I think that message has started to get through.”</p>

        <p>But all that failed to prevent another night of sporadic outbreaks of violence, although they were more or less kept under control by a large police presence. Eight people were arrested; four have been charged with possession of offensive weapons and breach of the peace, and four were released without charge. The most significant incident on Sunday was the murder of an Afro-Caribbean man in Melbourne Avenue, Newtown (less than a mile from Lozells Road). Aaron James, 18, died from a gunshot wound to the head, although it is not yet clear if the incident was connected to the riots.</p>
